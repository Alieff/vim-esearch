# Vim Easy Search

Deep development version of the vim plugin performing pseudo-async recursive search in files.  
Simple usage example:

    nnoremap <leader>ff :call EasySearch()<CR>

Use "s", "v" and "t" buttons to open file under the cursor in split, vertical split and in tab
accordingly. Use "shift" button to open a file silently.
